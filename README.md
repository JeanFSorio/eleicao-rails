# [Histórico Eleições](https://eleicao-historico.up.railway.app/)

[This project](https://eleicao-historico.up.railway.app/) goal was to make a log of every minute update of an API, [this API](https://resultados.tse.jus.br/oficial/ele2022/545/dados-simplificados/br/br-c0001-e000545-r.json) was showing the current progress in the electoral results. 

So from time to time I saved in a mongodb a log with my [python observer](https://github.com/JeanFSorio/python-api-observer).
